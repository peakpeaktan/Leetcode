/*
Given an array of unique integers preorder, return true if it is the correct preorder traversal sequence of a binary search tree.


Example 1:


Input: preorder = [5,2,1,3,6]
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: preorder = [5,2,6,1,3]
Output: false

Constraints:

1 <= preorder.length <= 104
1 <= preorder[i] <= 104
All the elements of preorder are unique.


Follow up: Could you do it using only constant space complexity?

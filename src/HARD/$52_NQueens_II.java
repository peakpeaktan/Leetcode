The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

Given an integer n, return the number of distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

Input: n = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown.
Example 2:

Input: n = 1
Output: 1


Constraints:

1 <= n <= 9
